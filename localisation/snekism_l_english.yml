 snek_religion_desc:1 "The Church of the Victoria Snek covers a wide range of faiths dating back before the neolithic revolution, but now is primarily a syncretism of Victoria and Snek worship. The former prophesies she shall return for the third time to save the chosen people of Britain by introducing them to the wonders of industrialization, colonialism, and trade. The first time she saved Britain was in her mortal days. The second time she saved Britain was from the pagan Romans. The third time, she shall return to us and build her Queendom once again on Earth. The latter features the deification of Snakes and the belief that one day that their messenger will return to redeem humanity. By the start of the game the religion of Victorious Snekism is primarily practiced around the East-Midlands of England, However the religion exists as a minority faith across the world, with communities continuing their worship from before the arrival of settled civilization."
