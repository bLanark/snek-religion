 #Rediscovering our roots? - Teotihuacan
  snekreligion.1_name:0 "Rediscovering our roots?"
  snekreligion.1_desc:0 "After our brave conquistadors entered Teotihuacan, they discovered something disturbing. After the giant heathen temples were ransacked by our soldiers, they found images of a “heathen god” which bore a striking resemblance to our Lord, Snek. Some soldiers have proclaimed this to be blasphemy, but our priests are intrigued by where these people gained this knowledge."
  snekreligion.1_1:0 "Heathens, all of them!"
  snekreligion.1_2:0 "We should learn what they know"

  snekreligion.2_name:0 "A Most Serpentine & Serene Quincentenary"
  snekreligion.2_desc:0 "It has been 500 years since the founding of our church. Long have we waited for the return of our scaled queen. Times have been dark, subjugation at the hands of Alba, cruel. But, as we near the anniversary, the peasants have been whispering of a new golden era. Is it time once again to slither out of obscurity? Is it time to cease waiting, and begin heralding the return of our Lord and Savior? Indeed it is! We shall weather all incoming storms and retake our island, whatever the cost may be!"
  snekreligion.2_1:0 "And weather it we shall!"

  snekreligion.4_desc:0 "Long ago the apostate “Saint'' Patrick turned his back on Victorious Snekism and drove its followers into the sea. Today we rectify that catastrophe by throwing all Catholic items into the sea! We have returned Ireland to the true faith! Ave the Messiah! Ave Snek!"

  snekreligion.6_name:0 "Do Counts count?"
  snekreligion.6_desc:0 "An English nobleman has been gaining unprecedented popularity and support as of late, not only from his peers, but also from amongst the peasantry of Britain. They see him as, among other things, a countryman and a symbol of English power. He is not, however, without enemies. A great many Dutch nobles contest his claim to the County of Norfolk on the basis that he is English, not Dutch, and therefore not eligible for the title due to his lower social class within the realm."
  snekreligion.6_1:0 "We shall recruit him"
  snekreligion.6_2:0 "We will support him and his quest for equality"
  snekreligion.6_3:0 "We must oppose him"

  snekreligion.9_desc:0 "We have successfully reclaimed one of the holy sites of the Church of the Victorious Snek.

 #symposium
  englishport.1.t:0 "Symposium of Faith and Knowledge"
  englishport.1.d:0 "Our Churches are vital platforms of intellectual and policy debate. Our God, Snek, embodies the persuit of enlightenment through meandering and protracted debates. The findings and their rigorous, protracted debates are a sure sign of our faith."
  englishport.1.a:0 "Splendid!"

 #Female Suffrage"
  englishport.2.t:0 "Female Suffrage"
  englishport.2.d:0 "Years ago, a “Voting Reform Act” was mandated by our overlord which specified that only male persons may hold the right to vote, undermining the rights held by women guaranteed by our faith. Led by the disgruntled upper-class ladies, women both poor and rich took to the streets in protest. Their triumphant marching chant “Equal Votes for Equal Women!” was sung in chorus throughout the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as we declared our independence. Even the most conservative amidst the government cannot deny the wisdom of gender equality from our God and the impact their spirit has had on our national identity and our fight for freedom. Though we made no explicit promise to extend suffrage to women, their instrumental role in breaking us free from the shackles of yesterday compels…"

  englishport.2.b:0 "Catastrophe! No deity intended for this ghastly mess!"

 #Open Government 
  englishport.3.t:0 "Open Government"
  englishport.3.d:0 "There can no longer be any doubt that the [ROOT.GovernmentName] of [ROOT.GetName] has somehow managed to become both byzantine and efficient at once - no matter how baffling or oxymoronic such a statement may be. Its famed corps of civil servants at the White Rose Hall stand ready to serve the nation in all bureaucratic and diplomatic matters. Recently however, a pamphlet in circulation has revealed that the Revenue Agency has more employees than our navy, and decries the former as a waste of money. This has been an acute matter of embarrassment, and has created a dilemma for our [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle], who has long promoted the vital role of our grand fleet in the defense of our island home. Ships, however, cannot run a nation alone. The sailors will need to be assuaged without compromising the administration. How should we respond to this pamphlet?"
  englishport.3.a:0 "Perhaps the government thinks that a bureaucracy is the best form of defense."
  englishport.3.b:0 "The public doesn’t know anything about wasting government money, we're the experts."

  englishport.4.d:0 "A guild of traders called the Yorkist Chamber has proposed the creation of the York Stock Exchange. Although currently holding minimal export value or financial importance, it has prime access to the coal mines of Northern England and the Humber Estuary. With enough investment it could yet grow further and act more competitively, serving as a financial hub for our burgeoning merchant class, boosting the [Root.GetAdjective] trade, manufacturing and economy as a whole. [Root.GetName] would then benefit from an easy and reliable access to credit."
  englishport.4.a:0 "Expand the Loan Market"
  englishport.4.b:0 "Exercise Caution and Strict Oversight"
  
 #Canceling of Glass Monopolies 
  englishport.5.t:0 "Canceling of Glass Monopolies"
  englishport.5.d:0 "The granting of monopolies has long been a tool to reward those who are most loyal, and the glass monopoly is no exception. Though our [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] was always an ardent fan of façon de venise glass, its grant of monopoly is deeply resented by the artisans and craftsmen of both England and the Low Countries. Revoking the prerogative may yield considerable benefits to the people, albeit at a hit to the budget."
  englishport.5.a:0 "Cancel the Monopolies"
  englishport.5.b:0 "Extend them by 10 more years"
  
 #Glassmania 
  englishport.6.t:0 "Glassmania"
  englishport.6.d:0 "Recently, glass has become popular among the rich merchant classes in the [ROOT.GetName] as a luxury item. Following rapid market growth fueled by an ever rising demand, speculators entered the market in the summer of 1635, perpetuating the upward trend. The following year, a futures market was created, and during the autumn and winter the prices skyrocketed when a monopoly on façon de venise glass production expired. The prices finally collapsed in February 1637. The result was the mass default on debt and the bankruptcy of many, a potential nation wide economic disaster if not managed correctly."
  englishport.6.a:0 "Bail out the glassmakers."
  englishport.6.b:0 "Our God can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men."

  snekreligion.12_desc:0 "At the end of the 7th century, the Catholic Saint Patrick renounced his ties to the Victorious Snekkist church. A horde of Snakes, concerned for his immortal soul, petitioned him to come back, begging that he accept the word of the Prohpet, and await their return. Disgusted, he cast them into the sea, exiling them from their homelands. As a final insult he then came to the Irish, and taught them of the Church of Christ. Millions of Snakes perished, all for the soul of one man. For these crimes, we must take back these lands, and return them to her scaled embrace."

  snekreligion.17_desc:0 "Ever since the revolution of 1444, pretenders to the throne have waited abroad to overthrow our fledgling republic.

 #dawn_of_a_people
  snekreligion.19_name:0 "Dawn of A People"
  snekreligion.19_desc:0 "For centuries, the Dutch have migrated in large numbers to Britain and settled with the locals. Over time cultural lines have been blurred and now many Dutch migrants have now integrated into their local communities. Despite the governments best efforts to enforce Dutch culture on the locals, decades of commerce and intermarriage have led to a unique melting pot of culture which is neither Anglo-Saxon or Dutch. These communities were initially disjointed and lacked a central identity, however with the invention of the printing press the first ‘Nedersakisch’ dictionaries have been produced. Despite being banned by the state, these dictionaries have spread across the island, leading to a birth of Nedersakisch art, culture and writing. Many are now demanding representation in Government and an end to discriminatory practices."

  snekreligion.21_desc:0 "Maintaining a unified vision of a religion is hard, it is to be expected that some heretics will arise and question the word of our clergy. However recently a group of heretics has gotten unusually large, they believe that the Prophet and Snek are already living among us and are currently infiltrating our clergy."
  snekreligion.21_1:0 "Let us purge these impostors"
